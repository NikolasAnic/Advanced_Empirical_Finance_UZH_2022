# Advanced Empirical Finance

**GitHub Repository to the Coding Sessions**

This is the GitHub Repository for the Coding Sessions of the subject **Advanced Empirical Finance** by [Prof. Dr. Per Ã–stberg](https://www.bf.uzh.ch/de/persons/oestberg-per) at the University of Zurich. 

The coding sessions provide theory and simulation based intuittions to mathematical and statistical concepts as well as offer the empirical applications of the topics discussed during the lecture. Data is specifically targeted at the Swiss Market for the period of 1990 to 2021. The coding sessions are entirely held in the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/) based on [Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) files which are assembled to one major [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/configuration.html) file. This book serves as a consortium of numerous theoretical and applied resources related to the statistical inference, quantitative finance as well as asset management and risk assessment literature. The theoretical concepts related especially to the mathematical properties of statistical analysis as well as causal inference are mainly borrowed from the resources of [Introductory Econometrics for Finance](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introductory-econometrics-for-finance/75E9C608EA95A3AD87FB3BC683B9EBBF), [Probability and Statistics for Finance](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Probability+and+Statistics+for+Finance-p-9780470400937) as well as [The elements of statistical learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf). The coding implementation borrows and advances from pre-existing bookdown courses by [Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics with R](https://bookdown.org/compfinezbook/introcompfinr/Time-Series-Models.html), [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) [Time Series](https://bookdown.org/gary_a_napier/time_series_lecture_notes) as well [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) and [Analyzing Financial Data and Implementing Financial Models](https://www.cliffordang.com/).  

If interested, readers can gain first introductions to the R programming environment through resources offered by the book [Quantitative Research Methods for Political Science, Public Policy and Public Administration](https://bookdown.org/josiesmith/labbook/introduction-to-r-rstudio-and-r-markdown.html) or [A sufficient introduction to R](https://dereksonderegger.github.io/570L/16-rmarkdown-tricks.html). 

Although the coding sessions are predominantly held in the R coding language, direct implementation of certain topics at hand are provided by the resources called [Python for Finance](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Finance-Cookbook-libraries-financial-ebook/dp/B083KG9DC7), [Mastering Python for Finance](https://www.orellfuessli.ch/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1055069428) as well as [Machine Learning in Finance](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-41068-1). 

This bookdown file is a constantly evolving project which should provide students and professionals with a toolbox for a multitude of subjects in empirical and quantitative finance topics. It is open source and any collaboration is greatly appreciated. If you have any remarks or want to participate in a chapter feel free to reach out to nikolas.anic[at]bluewin.ch. 

The topics under process / in projection are currently: 

- ARCH / GARCH implementations and general volatility forecasting
- Quantitative Risk Management topics 
- Machine Learning applications in Finance 
- Bayesian Statistics for Finance 
- Documentation of the code in Python
